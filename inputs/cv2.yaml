          - Developed the initial product, a backtesting and analysis tool for crypto traders using Python, Solidity, NextJS, and more. We provide a complete solution, from data sourcing to strategy development and testing to result analysis—our product covers it all.
          - Leading a team of 5 engineers to expand and add features. Still averaging over 2,000 GitHub contributions per year.
          - Raised close to <u>2M USD</u> in VC funding, including <u>a16z</u> and other top-tier investors, and onboarded institutional clients.
          - Regularly attend and speak at conferences, meet with industry stakeholders, organize hackathons, and more.
#          - Participated in an 8-week on-site program by Andreessen Horowitz in London.

          label: "Software Engineer - Google X, Munich"
          startdate: 2019
          enddate: 2022
        points:
          - Worked as an Applied AI engineer at Google X (Moonshots), where I owned the AI training pipeline (PyTorch, Docker, Kubernetes).
          - Conceived and built an internal ML model for monitoring Google’s servers. Used to monitor millions of machines in production.
          - Received a consistent rating of "Strongly Exceeds Expectations." Promoted after the first year.

      - heading:
          logo: /logo_volkswagen.png
          label: Deep/Machine Learning Engineer - Volkswagen, Munich
          startdate: 2018
          enddate: 2019
        points:
          - Developed a 2D perception model for autonomous driving using Convolutional Neural Networks (PyTorch, CUDA, C++).
          - Researched and built the models, then orchestrated the training and optimization loop, along with creating analysis tools.
          - Converted the final model to run on an embedded in-car device using quantization, pruning, and TensorRT. This involved low level C++ development on an embedded Nvidia device.

          enddate: 2017
        points:
          - Worked on an HPC codebase (simulating fluid flow around aircraft), distributed over 100s to 1000s of machines (C++, MPI, OpenMP).
          - Researched uncertainty quantification in physical simulations using Bayesian methods and machine learning.
          - Contributed to shape optimization of supersonic aircraft wings through a collaborative C++ HPC codebase.
          - Finished the bachelor’s degree in the top 1%.
