          - Developed the initial product, a backtesting and analysis tool for crypto traders using Python, Solidity, NextJS, and more. We provide a complete solution, from data sourcing to strategy development and testing to result analysis—our product covers it all.
          - Leading a team of 5 engineers to expand and add features. Personally contributed to Coinbase and Langchain.
          - Built an comprehensive API for execution and trading in crypto. Added Langchain and MCP tools on top to allow LLMs to interact with it.
          - Raised close to <u>2M USD</u> in VC funding, including <u>a16z</u> and other top-tier investors, and onboarded institutional clients.
          - Regularly attend and speak at conferences, meet with industry stakeholders, organize hackathons, and more.
          - Participated in an 8-week on-site program by Andreessen Horowitz in London.

          label: "Software Engineer - Google X, Munich"
          startdate: 2019
          enddate: 2022
        points:
          - Worked as an Applied AI engineer at Google X (Moonshots), where I owned the AI training pipeline (PyTorch, Docker, Kubernetes).
          - We built a wearable device that has been release and recently featured in [Time Magazine](https://time.com/7094544/arcteryx-and-skip-mo-go)
          - Conceived and built an internal ML model for monitoring Google’s servers. Used to monitor millions of machines in production.
          - Received a consistent rating of "Strongly Exceeds Expectations." Promoted after the first year.

          logo: /logo_volkswagen.png
          label: Deep/Machine Learning Engineer - Volkswagen, Munich
          startdate: 2018
          enddate: 2019
        points:
          - Developed a 2D perception model for autonomous driving using Convolutional Neural Networks (PyTorch, CUDA, C++).
          - Researched and built the models, then orchestrated the training and optimization loop, along with creating analysis tools.
          - Converted the final model to run on an embedded in-car device using quantization, pruning, and TensorRT.
          - This project went from research phase over requirement gathering and training all the way to final deployment in the car.

          - WarrentBOTfett in an AI powered value investor powered by AI agents. It is inspired by the approach of the legendary US investor.
          - It runs once a day, reads market data and news articles related to SP500 stocks.
          - Then connects to my broker, analyzes current holdings and makes a desicion on whether to trade. Fully autonomously.
          - Everything it logged and a detailed, structured report  of it's desicions is being generated. See [https://warrenbotfett.streamlit.app](https://warrenbotfett.streamlit.app/).

          label: AI powered investment tracker
          startdate: 2024
          enddate: 2025
        points:
          - This is a tool I built for myself. It connects to all asset platforms such as bank accounts, brokers or crypto wallets.
          - Analyses all hooldings every day and writes details results to a database.
          - Visualization dashboard are being generated delivering insights into how investments are performing and providing feedback on desicions made in the past
          - Once a day, a AI-PDF report is generated by reading my entire holdings, analyazing the market and reading news. This report will highliht opportunities, dangers and relevant informations. This allows me to only spend 5 minutes a day and still stay on top of my finances.
