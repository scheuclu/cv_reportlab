          - Developed the initial product: a backtesting and analysis tool for crypto traders using Python, Solidity, NextJS, and more. We provide a complete solution—from data sourcing to strategy development, testing, and result analysis.
          - Leading a team of 5 engineers to expand and add features. Personally contributed to Coinbase and LangChain integrations.
          - Built a comprehensive API for crypto execution and trading. Added LangChain and MCP tools on top to allow LLMs to interact with it.
          - Raised close to <u>2M USD</u> in VC funding, including <u>a16z</u> and other top-tier investors, and onboarded institutional clients.
          - Regularly attend and speak at conferences, meet with industry stakeholders, organize hackathons, and more.
          - Participated in an 8-week on-site program by Andreessen Horowitz in London.

        points:
          - Worked as an Applied AI engineer at Google X (Moonshots), where I owned the AI training pipeline (PyTorch, Docker, Kubernetes).
          - Built a wearable device that has been released and recently featured in [Time Magazine](https://time.com/7094544/arcteryx-and-skip-mo-go).
          - Conceived and built an internal ML model for monitoring Google’s servers. Used to monitor millions of machines in production.
          - Received a consistent rating of "Strongly Exceeds Expectations." Promoted after the first year.

          logo: /logo_volkswagen.png
          label: Deep/Machine Learning Engineer – Volkswagen, Munich
          startdate: 2018
          enddate: 2019
        points:
          - Developed a 2D perception model for autonomous driving using Convolutional Neural Networks (PyTorch, CUDA, C++).
          - Researched and built the models, orchestrated the training and optimization loop, and created analysis tools.
          - Converted the final model to run on an embedded in-car device using quantization, pruning, and TensorRT.
          - This project progressed from the research phase through requirements gathering and training to final deployment in the car.

          - WarrenBOTfett is an AI-powered value investor driven by autonomous agents. It is inspired by the legendary US investor.
          - Runs once a day, reads market data and news related to S&P 500 stocks.
          - Connects to my broker, analyzes current holdings, and makes fully autonomous trading decisions.
          - Everything is logged and a detailed, structured report of the decisions is being generated. See [here](https://warrenbotfett.streamlit.app/).

      - heading:
          label: AI-Powered Investment Tracker
          startdate: 2024
          enddate: 2025
        points:
          - This is an AI tool I built for myself. It connects to all asset platforms, such as bank accounts, brokers, or crypto wallets.
          - Analyzes all holdings daily and stores detailed results in a database.
          - Generates visualization dashboards that deliver insights into performance and provide feedback on past decisions.
          - Once a day, an AI-generated PDF report is created by analyzing my holdings, reading the market, and processing news. It highlights opportunities, risks, and relevant information—allowing me to stay on top of my finances in just 5 minutes a day.
