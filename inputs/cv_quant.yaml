          - Developed the initial product, a backtesting and analysis tool for crypto traders. Using Python, Solidity, NextJS, and more. We provide a a complete solution, from data-sourcing to strategy development and testing to result analysis - our product covers it all.
          - Hired and leading a team of 5 engineers to expand and add features. Still averaging over 2,000 GitHub contributions per year.
          - Raised close to <u>2M USD</u> of VC funding, including <u>a16z</u> and other top-tier investors. Onboarded institutional clients.
          - Regularly attending and speaking at conferences, meeting with industry stakeholders, organizing hackathons, and more.
#          - Participated in a 8 week on-site program by Andreesen Horrowitz in London.
