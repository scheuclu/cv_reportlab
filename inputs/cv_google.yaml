          - Developed the initial product, a backtesting and analysis tool for crypto traders using Python, Solidity, NextJS, and more. We provide a complete solution, from data sourcing to strategy development and testing to result analysis—our product covers it all.
          - Leading a team of 5 engineers to expand and add features. Still averaging over 2,000 GitHub contributions per year.
          - Built a comprehensive API for excution and trading in crypto. Added Langchain and MCP tools on top to allow LLMs to interact with it.
          - Raised close to <u>2M USD</u> in VC funding, including <u>a16z</u> and other top-tier investors, and onboarded institutional clients.
          - Regularly attend and speak at conferences, meet with industry stakeholders, organize hackathons, and more.
#          - Participated in an 8-week on-site program by Andreessen Horowitz in London.

          enddate: May 2022
        points:
          - I went through the <u>Entrepreneur First accelerator</u> where I explored several ideas, which eventually culminated in Compass Labs.
          - Entrepreneur First is a global talent investor that helps individuals find co-founders, develop startup ideas, and build high-growth technology companies from scratch.
          - Entrepreneur First has an acceptance rate of about 1%.

          enddate: 2021
        points:
          - Started as a Site Reliability Engineer at Google. In my first 6 months, I ideated and built an analytics pipeline to monitor global rollout policy compliance across Google. [go/scheucher-rocks](https://go/scheucher-rocks).
          - I did a bungee placement at Google X (Moonshots), where we built a wearable device that was released and recently featured in [Time Magazine](https://time.com/7094544/arcteryx-and-skip-mo-go).
          - Received a consistent rating of "Strongly Exceeds Expectations." Promoted after the first year.

          label: Deep/Machine Learning Engineer - Volkswagen, Munich
          startdate: 2018
          enddate: 2019
        points:
          - Developed a 2D perception model for autonomous driving using Convolutional Neural Networks (PyTorch, CUDA, C++).
          - Researched and built the models, then orchestrated the training and optimization loop, along with creating analysis tools.
          - Converted the final model to run on an embedded in-car device using quantization, pruning, and TensorRT.
          - Attended international conferences like NeurIPS, presented our company and brought valuable learnings back to our team.
